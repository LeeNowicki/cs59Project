Domain
================
Scheduling and calendar creation. 

Problem
================
It is hard to create and populate a personal calendar, as well as share it with other people.

Valid Inputs
================
The language will have default keywords and classes built in to the language, with the user having the ability to extend them as necessary. These start with a capital letter, and each line must start with one of them.

The following would be hello world in our language (using the Reminder keyword)
~~~
Reminder "Hello World" Now stdout
~~~

The language will accept these inputs to populate a calendar
~~~
Class 16:00 to 18:00
Class 1600 to 1800
Class 1600 - 1800
Class 4:00 pm - 6 pm
Class "CS" 16:00 to 18:00

Meeting "Project 19:00 to 21:00
Invite "Lee" to "Project"
Repeat "CS" Weekly ## or Biweekly, Annually, etc
Repeat "CS" Weekly on Tuesday and Thursday
Repeat "CS" Weekly on Tues and Thurs

Extend "CS" on August 2 1 hour
Extend "CS" on Aug 2 1 hour
Extend First "CS" 1 hour
Cancel "Project" on July 8
~~~

The output for this would be the events being rendered in the gui component.

The language will not accept these inputs:
~~~
Class "Arabic" 19:00 to 25:00 ## Time out of range
Extend "DNE" on August 2 1 hour ## Reference to event not initialized
Meeting Party "thing" ## Two keywords used, invalid
Extend Tenth "Study Session" on July 1 1 hour 
~~~

Functionality
================
We will have a GUI component to display the created calendar as well as create a JSON or other format for storing the data on the calendar. 


Meeting & Approval dates
================
We met 7/15/2025 and were approved on that date. Our group met on 7/17 to finalize the readme for this milestone.
