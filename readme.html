P00 - Introduction
================

Domain
----------------
Scheduling and calendar creation. 

Problem
----------------
It is hard to create and populate a personal calendar, as well as share it with other people.

Valid Inputs
----------------
The language will have default keywords and classes built in to the language, with the user having the ability to extend them as necessary. These start with a capital letter, and each line must start with one of them.

The following would be hello world in our language (using the Reminder keyword)
~~~
Reminder "Hello World" Now stdout
~~~

The language will accept these inputs to populate a calendar
~~~
Class 16:00 to 18:00
Class 1600 to 1800
Class 1600 - 1800
Class 4:00 pm - 6 pm
Class "CS" 16:00 to 18:00

Meeting "Project 19:00 to 21:00
Invite "Lee" to "Project"
Repeat "CS" Weekly ## or Biweekly, Annually, etc
Repeat "CS" Weekly on Tuesday and Thursday
Repeat "CS" Weekly on Tues and Thurs

Extend "CS" on August 2 1 hour
Extend "CS" on Aug 2 1 hour
Extend First "CS" 1 hour
Cancel "Project" on July 8
~~~

The output for this would be the events being rendered in the gui component.

The language will not accept these inputs:
~~~
Class "Arabic" 19:00 to 25:00 ## Time out of range
Extend "DNE" on August 2 1 hour ## Reference to event not initialized
Meeting Party "thing" ## Two keywords used, invalid
Extend Tenth "Study Session" on July 1 1 hour 
~~~

Functionality
----------------
We will have a GUI component to display the created calendar as well as create a JSON or other format for storing the data on the calendar. 

P01 - Grammar
================
We wrote a grammar (in the ANTLR style) that we believe will be able to parse the inputs
we defined earlier, with some exceptions. 

Rather than immediately dealing with certain complicated RegExs we decided to add these as
stretch goals for later on in our language. Some of these goals include:
- Identifying dates of form 1/24/23
- Increasing the ways to write out weekdays and months
- Dealing with leap years
- Accepting non military (am/pm) times
- Operating on the "First" or "Second" etc. event with a certain "name"

~~~~
grammar Calendar;

start : line (line)* EOF;

line: keyword '\n'; 

keyword: action 
        | event ;

action: 'Invite' NAME ('to')? event (file)?
        | 'Repeat' NAME frequency 
        | 'Extend' NAME date duration
        | 'Cancel' NAME (date)?
        | 'Reminder' NAME (date| date time| time) (file)?
        |
        ;

event: ID (NAME)? time (date)? ;

frequency: 'Every' weekday ('and' weekday)*
        |'Biweekly' (weekday)? ('and' weekday)*
        |'Annually'
        |'Weekly' (weekday)? ('and' weekday)*
        |'Monthly'
        //etc
        ;
weekday: 'Mon'
    | 'Tues'
    |'Wed' | 'Wednesday'
    |'Thurs'
    |'Fri'
    |'Sat'
    |'Sun';

file: 'stdout'; //add others

duration: (INT ('hours'|'min'|'sec'))+;

time: TIME
    | TIME 'to' TIME
    |TIME '-' TIME
    |'now';


date: ('Jan'|'Mar'|'May'|'July'|'Aug'|'Oct'|'Dec') THIRTYONE
    | ('Apr'|'Jun'|'Sep'|'Nov') THIRTY
    | 'Feb' TWENTYEIGHT
    |NUMERICDATE;



NAME :'"'.*'"' ;//Matches double quoted string

ID : [A-Za-z]([A-Za-z0-9])*;

INT: [0-9]([0-9])*;
        
THIRTYONE: ([1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|'3'[0-1]);

THIRTY: ([1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|'30');

TWENTYNINE: ([1-9]|[1-2][0-9]);

TWENTYEIGHT: ([1-9]|[1-2][0-8]);

TIME: ([0-1][0-9]|'2'[0-3])(':')?([0-5][0-9]);

NUMERICDATE: ; //We'll do that later
~~~~

It will match the inputs of:

Class 16:00 to 18:00

Class 16:00 - 18:00

along with something along the lines of:

Class "CS" 20:00 - 22:00

where a string identifier is included.

We also support repeats, but with slightly different syntax of: 

Repeat "CS" Weekly

Repeat "CS" Biweekly Tuesday and Thursday and Wednesday

Repeat "CS" Annually

Other supported inputs are:

Extend "CS" Aug 2 1 hour

Extend "CS" Aug 2 2 hour

Cancel "Project" July 8

This grammar should fail to parse all of our given bad inputs as they don't match our patterns.

For the earlier examples:

Class "Arabic" 19:00 to 25:00 ## Time out of range - 25 will not match the '2'[0-3] part of TIME

Extend "DNE" on August 2 1 hour ## Reference to event not initialized - this would be implemented when functionality is added

Meeting Party "thing" ## Two keywords used, invalid  - only one keyword per line 

Extend Tenth "Study Session" on July 1 1 hour - this would also be invalid when functionality is added, if there is no tenth study session on that date

As some additional examples, currently the grammar will not match:

1600 - 2000 "CS Class" ## A line must start with a keyword, and a time cannot be parsed as a keyword

Repeat "CS Class" ## No frequency given

Class "CS Class" 1600-2000 August 32 ## 32 will not match THIRTYONE




Meeting & Approval dates
================
We met 7/15/2025 and were approved on that date. Our group met on 7/17 to finalize the readme for this milestone.
We met on 7/23/2025 to begin writing a real grammar structure
